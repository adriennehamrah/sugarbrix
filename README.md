## SugarBrix - Visualizing sugar in food

*°Bx (degrees Brix) represents the amount of sugar by weight in a liquid. 1°Bx = 1g sucrose / 100g solution*

### Background

SugarBrix is a data visualization of sugar levels in common foods.

The goal is to bring greater awareness of sugar in everyday foods through interactive graphics.

### MVPs
+ Database of 100+ food items and sugar content
+ Animated transitions of sugar levels
+ Filter by categories - fruits, drinks, breakfast items, desserts, etc.
+ Search by specific food names
+ Infographic of AHA recommended sugar levels

### Wireframes
SugarBrix is a single page app with interaction graphics.

### Technologies
+ Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure
+ D3 for DOM manipulation and rendering
